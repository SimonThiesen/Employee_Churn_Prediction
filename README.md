# Employee_Churn_Prediction

## Project scope
Employee churn, i.e. employees leaving a firm, can be problematic for several reasons. Suitable replacements can be difficult and costly to find, it takes time for new employees to be fully productive, and ongoing projects may be delayed or terminated depending on the organization’s dependence on the lost employee (Saradhi & Palshikar, 2011). Thus, preventing valuable employees from churning is in the interest of many firms. Retention of valuable employees requires that we build a system that accurately classify which employees are likely to churn and the determinants/predictors of this behavior.

### Objectives 
build a model that is able to predict employee churn with the use of logistic regression with and without shrinkage to derive easy interpretable findings, exhibit improvement strategies and make data driven decisions on employee retention rate.

### Dataset
Ficitonal HR dataset consiting of 35 features, 310 observations. [Kaggle HR Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set/kernels)


## Results
### Final models

### Inference
The variables are indexed after the importance and according to the model the recruitment source, state of residence and specific managers are greatest linked with employee churn. 

In the report, the sign of influence of the coefficients are also extracted.
